A MySQL/PostgreSQL database that can be used to support management of the Asynchronous Management Protocol.  

The MySQL/PostgreSQL database was created using as generic SQL as possible allowing for easy porting to the user preferred flavor of SQL. 

This is version 1.0 of the new AMP database designed at JHUAPL, using lessons learned from previous iterations of an AMP database. This database confirms to Asynchronous Management Protocol draft-birrane-dtn-amp-08 the most recent version of AMP as of release. 
   
See [Here](Documents/Notes/AMP_Manager_SQL_Interface.md). This document defines the database and explains design decisions.  

## Setup
An example docker compose configuration script is provided as a convenient option for getting started.  See the comments at the top of docker-compose.yml for details.

Alternatively, a setup script (setup.mysql) is provided to conveniently source all required SQL files from the command line.  This would be the recommended approach for instantiating production systems.  See the file comments for details.
