=head1 DESCRIPTION

Starts the B<nm_mgr> application listening on I<mgr eid> for messages from B<nm_agent> clients.  Specify "--help" for full usage information.

An agent will automatically attempt to register with it's configured manager on startup.  Agents may also be added manually through the managers UI.

The manager provides a text based UI as its primary interface.  The UI provides capabilities to list, register, or delete agents. It can view received reports and tables, and be used to send commands (ARIs) to registered agents.

An experimental REST API is available if built with the configuration option "--enable-rest".  The default configuration will be accessible at http://localhost:8089/nm/api.
