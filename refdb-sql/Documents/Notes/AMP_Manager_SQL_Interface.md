# AMP Manager SQL Interface

This document describes a database for managing and storing AMP objects. It describes the design decisions and patterns used and gives justifications and examples. 
Where ever it was possible, generic SQL was used when creating the database. This was to make the database as reusable and protable as possible. This example of the AMP database was written in MySQL.
Uses entity relationship design pattern and has been normalized.

# The AMP SQL MODEL
## The formal and actual definition paradigm 
Objects can be seen as being in three different states, a formal definition, an actual definition, and evaluated. 
A formal definition for an object contains all the information that defines that object including any formal parameters. For an EDD this would mean its formal definition is its data type, description, and the type, name, and default values for its formal parameters i.e. formal def for ED1 is that it is of type float, is a temperature reading at a given time and has one parameter that is of type time value. 
An actual definition contains all the information that defines an object alongside values for arguments. The actual definition for ED1 is that it is of type float and the value for its parameter is 2019-01-01T08:00:00Z, matching the datatype of the formal parameter that defines this object. 
Evaluated is when an actor in the system, like an agent, takes the information from an actual definition and evaluates it, generating a valid value. For ED1 this would mean an agent taking the information stored in the actual definition and generating a physical value, like a temperature reading at a certain time.   

The amp database uses this design pattern when modeling the different ADM objects in a system. The database also takes advantage of knowing some objects are not parameterizable, essentially meaning that their formal and actual definitions are the same, to limit the amount of redundant information. Knowing this, the database only generates formal definitions for objects that can contain parameters. All other objects just have actual definitions. 
For instances when a user is creating an object of a type that could be parametrized, but this instance of that type is not parameterized then you would still create a formal definition then a singleton value of that formal definition in the actual definition. This maintain that the database is holistic, and information is not missing or doesnâ€™t require searching across several tables. For example, if a user request all the actual definitions for EDDs, they would only need to select from the Edd_actual_definition table instead of having to also select from Edd_actual_defintion for all the EDDs that do not have parameters. 
	 



## Parameter specifications

There are two types of Parameter specifications(parmspec), Formal which is used with formal object definitions to define formal parameters, object type, optional name, and optional default value, and actual parameters, object type, optional name, and actual value, which are used with actual object definitions to instantiate the objects, making them ready to be evaluated. Formal parameters can have a default value. This default value is a reference to an actual object definition.
	
Actual parameters can take 2 forms object parameters, and name parameters. Object parameters are parameters that are ADM objects. This is done by having the value of the actual_parm_object be a foreign key into the object_actual_definitions table. 

Name parameter are used when an actual parameter is not yet defined but instead is receiving its value from some other formal parameter. For example, if a report, R1, is defined as having one formal parameter, int A, and then its report entries are defined as ED1, ED2(1), ED2(A), where ED1 is singleton actual definition, ED2(1) is an actual definition with actual literal parameter int 1, and ED2(A) is an actual definition with actual name parameter A. This name parameter would reference the formal parameter A in R1 formal parameter spec. The name parameter value is a foreign key referencing a formal parameter. Then when ED2(A) need to be evaluated, another actual parameter that assigns a value to that formal parameter will be evaluated alongside it and that value can be assigned to A. 

Since actual parameter can references actual definitions and those actual definitions can have parameters that again reference other actual definitions, the database allows for recursive parameters. For example, a user can have an EDD, ed1, that takes an EDD as its only parameter, and another EDD, ed2, that takes an integer as a parameter. The database allows for a user to define an actual definition for ed1 that has the parameter ed1(ed1(ed2(3)).


## ARI
To normalize the database and avoid duplicative and complex data and
also allow for different binary encodings, ARI are not stored a single
field. Instead, all the different components of an ARI, a flag, an
optional nickname, object name, parameters, issuer, and tag, are
stored in various tables across the database. 

The flag byte can be generated after creating the other fields in the
ARI.

The optional nickname can be generated as defined in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-birrane-dtn-amp-08#section-7.1 by
using the `namespace_id` stored in `obj_metadata` and selecting `adm_enum`
from the adm table. Then using the data_type_id from obj_metadata you
can select the ADM Object Type Enumeration from the
`ADM_Type_Enumeration` table. The `data_type_id` information is also used
in the flag. 

The Object name is either `obj_formal_definition_id` from
`obj_formal_definition` or it is `obj_actual_definition_id` from
`obj_actual_definition`. both are zero based indexes and unique. 

For the parameter fields, each object that can be parameterized has an
entry for a parameter spec in their tables, that point to the
appropriate parm spec table.

Issuer and tag information is stored in the `network_config` table which
can be retrieved by using the `namespace_id` stored in `object_metadata`.


	
## Object Metadata
Object metadata as the super table for objects. It stores information common to all objects in the amp schema and the other object definition tables, actual and formal have foreign keys into object metadata.

    The outgoing_state table identifies four different wait states associated with sending controls to Agents. The format of the table is defined as follows.

## views
way to use join to put information in an easy way user can interact. Read-only but can Iâ€™ve information used on selects 
	for all the objects  
		join on metadata, the formal objects definition and formal parmspec info, and any other defining things type info table info etc. 

## stored procedures 
All the tables have their associated inserts and deletes wrapped around stored procedures to allow users to interact with the database in a control way, making sure that there are not any unintended or otherwise malicious effects of their actions. With deletion and removal of objects all of the lower tables and collection use cascade on deletion to help make sure nothing is left behind after the definition is deleted. This also means you only have to delete objects definition in obj_actual_definition/obj_formal_definition/obj_metadata to remove all references of it from the database.
